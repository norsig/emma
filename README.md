# Emma - Your personal switchboard operator

[Homepage](http://victorquinn.github.com/emma)

### About
This is an [OpenVBX](http://www.openvbx.org) style switchboard operator in node.

At its start it will be a simpler personal switchboard operator routing calls from Twilio numbers to phones in the real world (a la Google Voice) and later possibly expand to be a whole VBX system as OpenVBX is.

### Misc

This project is named for [Emma Nutt, the first female telephone operator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Nutt).
